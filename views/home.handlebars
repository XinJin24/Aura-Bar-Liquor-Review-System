<h1>Aura-Bar-Liquor-Review-System</h1>
<p>
    Start by highlighting the fact that there is a growing demand for information about bars and liquor products.
    People often want to know about the quality of service, pricing, ambiance, and the variety of drinks available.
    Our project can address this need by providing a platform for reviews and ratings.
    The project also aims to enhance the user experience for those looking for liquor options.
    By providing a user-friendly app, we're not only helping consumers find the best options but also saving their time and effort.
